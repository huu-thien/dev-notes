## What are SOLID principles
- They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing classes structure
- Help developers write readable, reusable, maintainable and scalable code
- They are:
	- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
	- **O**pen-Closed Principle
	- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
	- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
	- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle
> **"a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change"**

![](SOLID%20principles-020820231427.png)

- Only one potential change (database logic, logging logic...) in the softwareâ€™s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class
- If software's specifications change, we only need to modify a specific class, and less likely to break the whole application
- *Why it important*:
	- If we edit the same class for different reason -> incompatible modules
	- Makes version control easier: fewer conflicts will appear and easier to resolve
 
- Examples: this class need refactor because the SendEmail and ValidateEmail methods have nothing to do with the UserService class
```csharp
public class UserService
{
   public void Register(string email, string password)
   {
      if (!ValidateEmail(email))
         throw new ValidationException("Email is not an email");
         var user = new User(email, password);

         SendEmail(new MailMessage("mysite@nowhere.com", email) { Subject="HEllo foo" });
   }

   public virtual bool ValidateEmail(string email)
   {
     return email.Contains("@");
   }

   public bool SendEmail(MailMessage message)
   {
     _smtpClient.Send(message);
   }
}
```

## Open-Closed Principle
> **"software entities (classes, modules, functions...) should be open for extension and closed to modification"**

![](SOLID%20principles-020820231429.png)

- Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality
- We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class 
- It is usually done with the help of interfaces and abstract classes
- *Why it important*: avoid touching the tested and reliable code if possible

- *Note*: It's not possible to write code that suit for all future changes or perfectly closed -> do not overly complex the code

- Example: 
 ```csharp
public class InvoicePersistence {
    Invoice _invoice;

    public InvoicePersistence(Invoice invoice) {
        _invoice = invoice;
    }

    public void SaveToFile(string fileName, string fileType) {
		if (fileType == "json") 
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Saving invoice to json");
		}
		else if (fileType == "txt")
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Saving invoice to txt");
		}
    }
```

- Follow OCP:
```csharp
public interface IInvoicePersistence 
{
    public void Save(Invoice invoice);
}

public class JsonPersistence : IInvoicePersistence 
{
    public override void Save(Invoice invoice) {
        // Save to json
    }
}

public class TxtPersistence : IInvoicePersistence 
{
    public override void Save(Invoice invoice) {
        // Save to txt
    }
}

public class DatabasePersistence : IInvoicePersistence 
{
    public override void Save(Invoice invoice) {
        // Save to DB
    }
}
```

## Liskov Substitution Principle
> **"subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes and have it behave in the same manner without modification"**

![](SOLID%20principles-020820231429%201.png)

- This principle can be consider as an extension of the OCP. We must ensure that newly derived classes extend the base classes without changing their behavior
- Some checklist items to determine anti-Liskov:
	- **No new exceptions should be thrown in derived class**: on reverse, if base class throw NullException but subclass allow null, it also violates
	- **Pre-conditions cannot be strengthened**: ex. subclass requires a int params to be positive but the base class doesn't  
	- **Post-conditions cannot be weakened**: ex. base class requires db connection should be closed before return but the subclass doesn't
	- **Invariants must be preserved**: refer to the conditions that must hold true for the base class and its subclasses. Subclass must ensure that the invariants of the base class are preserved.
		- For example, a `List<T>` class has a `Length` property and an array of type `T[]`. Invariant of this class is that `Length` is always less than or equal to the length of the internal array. If a subclass of `List<T>` makes it so that `Length` can be greater than the length of the array -> violation of that invariant
- *Why it important*: when a class does not obey this principle, it leads to some bugs that are hard to detect

## Interface Segregation Principle
> **"clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each serving one submodule"**

![](SOLID%20principles-020820231430.png)

- The larger the interface, the more likely it includes methods not all implementers can use
- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- *Why it important*: easier to implement interfaces, increases the readability and maintainability

- example: 
```csharp
public interface ILead
{
   void CreateSubTask();
   void AssginTask();
   void WorkOnTask();
}

public class TeamLead : ILead
{
   public void AssignTask() {}
   public void CreateSubTask() {}
   public void WorkOnTask() {}
}

public class Manager : ILead
{
   public void AssignTask() {}
   public void CreateSubTask() {}
   public void WorkOnTask()
   {
      throw new Exception("Manager can't work on Task");
   }
}
```

- Manager can't work on a task, so we are forcing the Manager class to implement a WorkOnTask() method without a purpose
```csharp
public interface IProgrammer
{
   void WorkOnTask();
}

public class Programmer : IProgrammer
{
   public void WorkOnTask() {}
}

public class Manager : ILead
{
   public void AssignTask() {}
   public void CreateSubTask() {}
}

public class TeamLead: IProgrammer, ILead
{
   public void AssignTask() {}
   public void CreateSubTask() {}
   public void WorkOnTask() {}
}
```
## Dependency Inversion Principle
> **"high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes, both should depend upon abstractions"**
> 
> **"abstractions should not rely upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions"**

![](SOLID%20principles-020820231431.png)

- High-level modules/classes implement business rules or logic in a system. Low-level modules/classes deal with more detailed operations
- If high-level modules depend on low-level modules, it raises the risk that changes to one class will break the other -> need to make both of them dependent on abstractions instead of knowing each other

![](SOLID%20principles-020820232356.png)

- *Why it important*:
	- **Decoupling**: the code becomes more modular, making it easier to maintain, extend or replace completely
	- **Testability**: each module can be tested independently
	- **Reusability**: Modules become more reusable since they are less dependent on other modules

- example: the `EmailNotification` class is tightly coupled to the `SmtpClient` class
```csharp
public class EmailNotification
{
    private SmtpClient _smtpClient;

    public EmailNotification()
    {
        _smtpClient = new SmtpClient();
    }

    public void Send(string emailAddress, string message)
    {
        _smtpClient.Send(emailAddress, message);
    }
}
```

- Using DIP:
```csharp
public interface IEmailSender
{
    void Send(string emailAddress, string message);
}

public class SmtpClient : IEmailSender
{
    public void Send(string emailAddress, string message)
    {
        // Implementation of email sending using SMTP
    }
}

public class EmailNotification
{
    private IEmailSender _emailSender;

    public EmailNotification(IEmailSender emailSender)
    {
        _emailSender = emailSender;
    }

    public void Send(string emailAddress, string message)
    {
        _emailSender.Send(emailAddress, message);
    }
}
```
