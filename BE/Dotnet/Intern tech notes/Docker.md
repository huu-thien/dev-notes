## What is docker

- Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient and can run on everywhere

- Docker use the host OS for its containers, makes them light and increases the boot time
    - Light in weight
    - Faster boot time

## Basic concepts

- **Image**: is an immutable file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies… needed for an application to run. They represent an application and its virtual environment at a specific point in time.
    
- **Container**: An instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, which allows them to run consistently across different environments.
    
- **Layer architecture**:

    - A Docker image is typically multi-layered. On top of the base layer, other layers are added one by one
    - Basically, a _image layer_ is a change on an image
    - If we make a change to Dockerfile, docker will rebuild **only** the layer that was changed and the ones after that → layer caching
    - Whenever a container is created, a writable layer is also created. This layer is known as the container layer and it stores all the changes done to the running container.

- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. The result image can then be ran or used as base of other image
    
- **Volume**: a way to store and manage data in Docker containers. They are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers
    
- **Compose**: A cli tool and YAML file with metadata for defining and running multi-container applications
    

## Build a Docker image

- A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a image. Each instruction is represented by a keyword, which specifies the action to be taken
    
    - `FROM`: defines the base image used to start the build process
    - `ENTRYPOINT`: Sets the default application to be used every time a container is created with the image
    - `CMD`: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts
    - `ENV`: Sets environment variables within the container
    - `ADD`: Copies files from a source on the host into the container’s filesystem (can extract files, download or copy files from remote location)
    - `COPY`: Copies files from the build context into the container’s filesystem (faster than ADD)
    - `RUN`: Executes a command within the container
    - `EXPOSE`: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime
    - `USER`: sets the UID (or username) which is to run the container
    - `VOLUME`: Creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers
    - `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions that follow it
    - `LABEL`**:** add a label to docker image
    - `MAINTAINER`**:** defines a full name and email address of the image creator
- Create a docker image for [asp.net](http://asp.net) project
    
    ```docker
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
    WORKDIR /app
    EXPOSE 80
    EXPOSE 443
    
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY ["Lab2.csproj", "./"]
    RUN dotnet restore "Lab2.csproj"
    COPY . .
    WORKDIR "/src/."
    RUN dotnet build "Lab2.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
    
    FROM build AS publish
    RUN dotnet publish "Lab2.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
    
    FROM base AS final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Lab2.dll"]
    ```
    
    1. Use aspnet 7 image as base and exposes 80 and 443 port
    2. Use dotnet 7 image to build app.
        1. Copy csproj file to /src in container
        2. run dotnet restore to download any needed dependencies
        3. copy all other files
        4. build the app with Release configuration in /app/build
    3. Publish the app from app/build to app/publish
    4. copy publish files to /app and set the entry point for the container
- Build with this Dockerfile
    
    ```bash
    docker build . -t Lab2:dev
    ```
    
- Generate certificate and configure local machine
    
    ```bash
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p <CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER>
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
    ```
    
- Run the image:
    
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it -p 5001:80 -p 5000:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="<https://+>;<http://+>" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5000 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="Admin123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v ${HOME}/.aspnet/https:/https/ lab2:dev
    ```
    

## Docker compose

- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
    
- Some Docker-compose keywords:
    
    - `services`: used to define the different services that make up your application
    - `networks`: used to define the networks that your services will use
    - `volumes`: used to define the volumes that your services will use
    - `build`: used to specify how to build a service’s image
    - `image`: used to specify the image to use for a service
    - `ports`: used to map ports between the host and the container
    - `environment`: used to set environment variables for a service
- Dockerize [Asp.net](http://Asp.net) application and MSSQL Server
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      lab2.api:
        image: lab2
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Lab2/Dockerfile
        ports:
            - "5001:80"
            - "5000:443"
        environment:
          - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
          - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443;<http://+:80>
          - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=Admin123
          - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/lab2.pfx
          - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Server=lab2.db;Database=CRM3DB;User=sa;Password=Admin123;TrustServerCertificate=True
        volumes:
            - ~/.aspnet/https:/https:ro
        depends_on: 
          - lab2.db
      lab2.db:
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
        environment:
          - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
          - SA_PASSWORD=Admin123
        ports:
            - "1433:1433"
        volumes:
            - lab2data:/var/opt/mssql
    volumes:
      lab2data:
    ```
